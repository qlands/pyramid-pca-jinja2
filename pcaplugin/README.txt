PCA Plugin example
===============================

This is an example of a plugin that extends the HOST application

To build the plugin do:
$ python setup.py develop

Building the plugin does not make the HOST application to run it. You need to modify the HOST development.ini file and uncomment line 20 for the plugin to be loaded
